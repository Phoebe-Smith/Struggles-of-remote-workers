# The Hardships of Working from Home Without Work-Life Separation
Blurred Boundaries Between Work and Life

Digital revolution and conditions like the COVID 19 pandemic have revolutionized the workspace. The new working environment can be anywhere today. Your home, your vacation spot, even a medical. This flexibility and autonomy that accompanies remote work also comes with challenges for the remote workers. Remote work offers the opportunity to work from home or any space. The lack of boundaries in terms of time and space in the changing work setting has become overwhelming for many. 
Remote workers often struggle to manage work timings, prioritize tasks, set aside their work beyond working hours. Most working professionals find it difficult to switch off and maintain well-being. They end up taking work calls, checking emails late at night and ruining their sleep cycle. Working in improper environments leads to stress and anxiety and exhaustion together with additional worrying health complications in the long run. The improper use of beds and couches for working causes improper postures which results in back pain and spinal problems.
 
Burnout, Isolation and Loneliness

The lack of clear work timings and a disciplined approach to work unlike the physical work environment can cause distress. The pressure to be available online to meet clientâ€™s demand is one of the reasons workers tend to overwork themselves. Staying online and excessive cortisol levels have a positive correlation with each other and lead to increased stress levels. Burnouts in these scenarios can happen frequently and leave workers feeling drained mentally and tired physically. A few symptoms include changes in appetite, mood and sleep quality or quantity. 

One of the major consequences of remote work can be isolation and loneliness. While the team meetings online are convenient, human interaction is important for mental health. Many workers tend to stay glued to their screen, isolating themselves. Adopting habits to avoid for remote workers like setting boundaries can help in maintaining a healthier routine. 

Challenges to Staying Motivated

Remote work can be taxing and exhausting, often stripping down motivation. Lack of support from peers and misunderstanding can add to it. Home distractions that involve dealing with household tasks combined with family interruptions and interactions with pets create a challenging environment that produces procrastination. Remote workers should consider using the pomodoro technique to fight procrastination effectively. The combination of scheduled working hours and designated workspace together with time tracking applications assists with maintaining high levels of motivation.

Lack of Visibility

A lot of workers might feel that they are underperforming and struggle for recognition within the digital team. Coupled with stress and isolation these factors affect mental health negatively. An added performance pressure without actually being able to track progress can leave a lot of ambiguity. It is important to not fall into a spiral of self-assessment and negative self-talk during these times.  

Financial Stability Concerns

Apart from revolutionizing the workspace, the digital revolution has also witnessed empowering women through remote work. Women form a huge part of the remote workforce. But with flexibility and adaptability, also comes financial uncertainties. Staff augmentation leverages killed professionals from the global pool. Outsourcing can also lead to compromised salaries, job insecurity in terms of replacement for remote workers. It is essential to have an emergency fund, diversify income streams, and upskilling are some ways to stay secured financially. 

Pressure to Maintain Availability 

Adding to stress factors, the constant need to be glued to smartphones and desktops can cause mental distress. Workers across time-zones in remote work tend to compromise on sleep or nutrition to attend important clients. Setting working hours and sticking to it can be a major challenge for remote workers in such an environment. But it is possible to maintain a work-life balance and restore well-being. 

How To Establish Work Life Balance

Setting boundaries is an essential factor for establishing work-life balance. A structured daily plan chalked out as per the priority tasks can make it easier to stay motivated. Investing in an ergonomic chair and table can help set up a work environment that provides dedicated space and improves concentration. Try to be active physically and socially. Family, colleagues and surroundings from nature function as helpful networks that provide you with moments for relaxation. You should practice mindfulness and perform work that creates fulfillment as you need this to become productive. Contact your managers and supervisors for establishing practical targets together with reasonable performance expectations.
As women in  remote work, ensure that you communicate with your family regarding your schedule. Seek support in managing children in the house. Take regular breaks to ensure you are not sitting in a position for long hours. Dedicate going out for groceries or community work to engage outside the home. 

Conclusion

It is really difficult to achieve well-being as a remote worker without work-life balance. As we adapt to the new working environment the challenges it accompanies cannot be ignored. Smart work leads to a hassle-free life and work-life balance is a prominent example. Setting structured work schedules, prioritizing tasks, communicating and unwinding can aid in productivity while maintaining a good lifestyle. On the employer's side, equitable policies, fixed working hours and resource provision can support remote workers. Addressing these challenges and taking them head-on can help strengthen an equitable remote work environment.
